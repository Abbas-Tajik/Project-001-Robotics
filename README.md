  This task introduced me to the basics of robotics and simple automation. I built a small setup that
  could identify and pick up a can from a fixed position, mainly focusing on getting the movement and
  sensing logic working reliably. Most of the work involved testing, adjusting, and understanding how
  the mechanical and electronic parts behaved together. It was my first proper hands-on robotics exercise.
