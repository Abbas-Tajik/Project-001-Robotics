  This project focused on improving and optimising the Robot Can Picker algorithm using Python in VS Code. 
  The work involved refining the code logic, increasing efficiency, and ensuring readability. No physical 
  hardware was used; the assignment was purely software-based, focusing on algorithm development and testing.

  This project builds on the Robot Can Picking Challenge described in 
  <em>Complexity: A Guided Tour</em> by Melanie Mitchell (Oxford University Press, 2009). 
  The original implementation that inspired this work included several robot controllers, 
  such as rule-based agents, lookup-table models, Q-learning approaches, and a genetic-algorithm-evolved robot. 
  Reference materials included example scripts such as <code>main.py</code>, <code>test_drive.py</code>, 
  and <code>optimize_q_learner.py</code>, as well as the accompanying 
  <code>genetic_algorithm.ipynb</code> notebook, which demonstrated evolving a controller compatible with 
  <code>LookupTableRobot</code>.  
  My version adapts and extends these ideas for study and experimentation.
